"""
A small library for developing event-engine plugins in Python. 

The basic usage is as follows:

import zmq
from events import get_plugin_socket, get_next_msg, publish_msg, send_quit_command

# create the zmq context object
context = zmq.Context()

# create the socket object your plugin will use to communicate with the engine;
# pass the port configured for your plugin
# optionally pass the host address of the engine if it is not available on the docker network
socket = get_plugin_socket(context, port)  

# main plugin loop
while True:
    # get the next message
    msg_bytes = get_next_msg(socket)
    
    # ... do something with the message ...
    
    # publish a message
    publish_msg(socket, some_bytes)

    if some_condition:
        break

# send a quit command when done
send_quit_command(socket)
